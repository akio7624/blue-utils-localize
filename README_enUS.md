# BlueArchive Utils
[BlueArchive Utils](https://blue-utils.me) is an unofficial fan site that collects various information and related tools from the game <Blue Archive>.

# What is this repository?
Because Blue Acayutil provides data from Japanese and global servers at the same time, it also applies five languages (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and English) supported by Blue Archive to the site UI.

Korean is fully supported, Japanese and English rely on some translators, and the rest of the language uses a translator for parts without words translated into the game.
Especially, I don't know Thai and Chinese well, so English is mixed and provided to prevent mistranslation.

If you want to help translate the site, you can get the translation file here and translate it.

# A translation process
When the site is updated, I update the translation file and proceed with the basic translation in the way described above. Then push changes to this repository.

If you receive the file, translate it, and request it again, it will be applied after review.

# How do you translate it?
Site localization of BlueArchive Utils is using gettext of php.
The original translation file is provided as a po file. This file can be edited with programs such as [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/).
Please refrain from editing directly through the text editor to prevent grammatical errors in the file.

# Credit
If you would like to thank us, please write your name in the full request for translation and we will write your name in the translation help credit on the site information.
